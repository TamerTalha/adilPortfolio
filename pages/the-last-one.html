                <p>The Last One was developed in one week during our semester break, 
                    as a collaboration between me and two other game design students. 
                    Made for <a href = "https://itch.io/jam/space-game-jam-2">Space Game Jam #2</a> 
                    it was inspired by the themes “Space” and “The END.” The project served as both 
                    a creative exercise and a way to sharpen our Unity skills. </p>

            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>At the time, we had just begun exploring Unity in our game design specialization. 
                I had previously built a basic tower placement system with enemies following a set path, 
                and we decided to expand on that concept. The result was a tower defense game with a twist—you 
                don't upgrade towers, you upgrade enemies. With more time, we would have loved to expand the variety of towers, 
                enemies, and maps to enrich the gameplay further.</p>

            <h1>What I learned</h1>
            <p>This project was my first real experience collaborating with others on a game. 
                Working in a team taught me the importance of communication, task delegation, 
                and version control. We learned how to use Git properly with Unity, which helped streamline development. 
                I also deepened my understanding of Unity's architecture, particularly through researching and implementing 
                singletons to manage the game loop and various systems.
