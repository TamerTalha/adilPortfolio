                <p>The Last One is a game I made with 2 other game design students 
                    in the 1 week vacation we had to refine our skills further. 
                    This game was made for <a href = "https://itch.io/jam/space-game-jam-2">Space Game Jam #2</a> 
                    with the themes 'Space' and 'The END'.</p>

            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>In our game design specialization we had just started using Unity 
                and we wanted to make something by ourselves to get more familiar with it. 
                I already played around in Unity before and 
                I had made a project where I could place towers down on certain building places with enemies following a path. 
                We decided to use that small project and expand it to make a game out of it. 
                It turned out to be a tower defense game where instead of upgrading your towers you upgrade your enemies. 
                With more variety to towers, enemies or maps I believe we could have made the game more fun.</p>

            <h1>What I learned</h1>
            <p>This project's main focus for me was working together on a project with other people. 
                This was the first time for me and I'd say it went pretty well since we already had someone in the 
                team that had little experience with working together. We learned how to use git with Unity properly in a 
                team. I also learned about singletons in Unity and when to use them and when to not use them. 
                Mainly I made the game loop so that led me to research singletons to make managers.
