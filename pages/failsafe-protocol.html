                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>Failsafe Protocol was made for the <a href = "https://itch.io/jam/bigmode-game-jam-2025">Bigmode Game Jame 2025</a> with the theme 'POWER'.
                    I developed the game alongside my brother, who contributed with pixel art. 
                    While this version was built under a time constraint, we hope to revisit and expand the game in the future—with new features, 
                    more polish, and deeper mechanics.</p>

            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>This resource management-style game was my first entry into the world of game jams. 
                Developed for Bigmode Game Jam 2025, Failsafe Protocol challenged me to apply and sharpen my recently acquired Lua skills using LÖVE2D. 
                It was a rewarding experience that pushed me to design under time constraints while exploring new gameplay mechanics.</p>

            <h1>What I learned</h1>
            <p>The goal of this project was to build a complete game loop using a framework I had just learned—LÖVE2D. 
                Failsafe Protocol helped me achieve that and gave me valuable insight into how games are structured and developed within a game framework. 
                It was a hands-on way to turn curiosity into practical experience.</p>
