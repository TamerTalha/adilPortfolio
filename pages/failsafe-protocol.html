                <p>Failsafe Protocol was made for the <a href = "https://itch.io/jam/bigmode-game-jam-2025">Bigmode Game Jame 2025</a> with the theme 'POWER'.
                    I made the game with my brother where he worked on a few pixel arts. 
                    We hope to someday continue developing this game, add new features and polish it further.</p>

            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>This resource management like game was a fun challenge for me to get into the world of game jams as it was the first game I made for a game jam.
                 I had learned Lua for LÖVE2D recently as well so I wanted to refine my skills with lua further by making another game with it.</p>

            <h1>What I learned</h1>
            <p>The main goal for this project was to make a full game loop in a game framework that I recently learned how to use. 
                This project was a great way to reach my goal. 
                I also was curious about how games are made inside game frameworks and this project was a great way of learning how.</p>
