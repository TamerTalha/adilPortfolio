                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>Retro Pong was my first project that I 'finished' and distributed for the first time. 
                    It was initially just the product of a lecture from <a href = "https://cs50.harvard.edu/games/2018/">CS50's Introduction to Game Development</a>. 
                    But after making the assignment for the lecture, it led me to want to work on it more.</p>

            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>As it says in the description of the game in <a href = "https://fairvanguard.itch.io">my itch.io page</a>, 
                this is a simple pong game with some cool shaders in my opinion. 
                After making the assignment for the lecture I made more difficulties using different methods and then I proceeded to add some shaders that I found on internet.</p>

            <h1>What I learned</h1>
            <p>The main goal of this project was to just make something finished and distribute it somewhere. Which is achieved. 
                Initially putting shaders was not the plan but after discovering the world of shaders 
                I got very interested in them and decided to put in a few in Retro Pong. 
                I especially had a nice challenge with the shockwave shader that plays when it is scored. 
                With the help of this project I got used to LÃ–VE2D more and learned how shaders can be used.</p>
