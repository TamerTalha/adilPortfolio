                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>Retro Pong began as a simple assignment from 
                    <a href = "https://cs50.harvard.edu/games/2018/">CS50's Introduction to Game Development</a>, 
                    but quickly grew into something more. It became my first fully completed and distributed game project. 
                    What started as a learning exercise evolved into a deeper exploration of game polish and visual effects.</p>

            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p><a href = "https://fairvanguard.itch.io">Retro Pong</a> is a simple yet stylish take on the classic Pong game, 
                enhanced with visual flair through custom shaders I discovered and integrated. 
                What started as a lecture assignment from CS50’s game development course evolved into a 
                passion project—leading me to add multiple difficulty levels and experiment with various techniques 
                to make the game more engaging.</p>

            <h1>What I learned</h1>
            <p>The main goal of this project was to complete and distribute a game—and I achieved that. 
                Along the way, I discovered the world of shaders, which wasn't part of the original plan. 
                This unexpected interest led me to experiment with visual effects, including a particularly rewarding challenge: 
                implementing a shockwave shader triggered on scoring. Through Retro Pong, I became more comfortable with 
                LÖVE2D and gained valuable experience using shaders to enhance gameplay visuals.</p>
